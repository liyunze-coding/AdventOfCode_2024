# Advent of Code 2024

## What is it?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## My personal goals

- To complete the puzzles [on my livestreams](https://twitch.tv/RythonDev)

- Programming language goals:
  - [x] Python
  - [x] Go
  - [ ] Rust
  - [ ] C#
  - [ ] Typescript
  - [ ] Java
  - [ ] Kotlin
  - [ ] C++
