# Advent of Code 2024

## What is it?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## My personal goals

- To complete the puzzles [on my livestreams](https://twitch.tv/RythonDev)
- Avoid usage of ChatGPT, Github Copilot and other LLMs (or to use it as little as possible)
- Use less familiar programming languages more often
- Programming language goals:
  - [x] Python
  - [x] Go
  - [x] Rust
  - [x] C#
  - [x] Typescript
  - [ ] Java
  - [ ] Kotlin
  - [ ] C++
